When wanting to create a local repository connected to my remote repository, the following steps should be followed:
1) Initialize the directory with files you want to edit and commit.
2) Use git clone to include the URL or SSL to the remote repository.
3) Use git remote add to push your first commit to the remote repository. Can also use commit to make commits to local
repository
4) For future commits, git push is all that is needed.
